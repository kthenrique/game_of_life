== Proposed Solution

The 2D space is reduced to an enclosing quadrilateral, and each possible cell within it is represented
by a unique prime number.
The product of all prime numbers corresponding to alive cells, together with the enclosing quadrilateral,
serves as a replacement for the list of cells.

Example:

- Alive cells: (0,1), (1,1)
- Calculated enclosing quadrilateral: (1,1)
- Filled with primes:
  |===
  | 5 | 7 |
  | 2 | 3 |
  |===
- Therefore, the product for the alive cells is: 35
